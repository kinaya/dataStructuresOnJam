# Data structures on JAM

This repo was made to practice my knowledge in a bunch of things: Data structures, Headless Wordpress, JAM-stack and CSS Modules. I don’t know how you found it, but now that you’re here I hope you can use it to learn something as well <3

## Techniques

This interface is built using React/Next.js, the data is fetched from a headless Wordpress installation using it’s REST api, and the page is statically generated using Vercel. Webhooks are used to trigger Vercel to rebuild the page when committing to the master branch, or when Wordpress is updated.

## Se it in action
